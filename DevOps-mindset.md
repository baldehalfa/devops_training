# DevOps Mindset

## Defining DevOps
"DevOps is about __humans__. It is a set of practices and patterns that turn __human capital__ into high-performance __organizational-capital__" - _John Willis_

"DevOps is the emerging professional movement that advocates a __collaborative__ working __relationship__ between Development and IT Operations, resulting in the fast flow of planned work (For example: high deployment rates), while simultaneously increasing the __reliability__, __stability__, __resilience__ and __security__ of the product environment." - _Gene Kim_

A full lifecycle consists of __Building__, __Deploying__, __Operating__, and __Supporting__

## DevOps Principles: The Three ways
__Deming Quote__: "It is not necessary to change. __Survival is not mandatory__." _- Dr. William Edwards Deming_

__System Thinking__: __The three ways__ developed by __Gene Kim__ and __Mike Orzen__

1- __System Thinking__: Emphasizes __performance__ of the entire system. Also __collaboration__ across functional lines and focus on IT-enabled __value streams__
The outcome of system thinking are the following: __stop passing defects__ downstream, Does not allow local optimization, Always seeking to __increase flow__, and always seeking to profound __understanding__ of the system
__Quote:__ "Quality is __everyone's responsibility__". _- Edwards Deming_

2- __Amplifying feedback loops__
__Feedback Loops__ is a process that allows for refection on its own output before determining the next steps that need to be completed.
The outcome of feedback loops are the following: understanding and responding to all customers, shortening and amplifying all feedback loops, and then embedding knowledge where needed.
To improve feedback loops, we need to: build __automated tests__ into pipeline and also embed operations engineer into development teams.


3- __A culture of continuous experimentation and learning__
__creating__ that culture!, Encouraging __risk taking__ & __failing forward__, Affirm that __repetition__ in practice is a __prerequisite to mastery__
The outcome of this third way is about: allocating time for __improvement work__, rewarding teams for __taking risks__, and introduce faults into the system to __increase resilience__

## DevOps Principles: The Seven Principles and Seven Wastes of Lean

Principle #1- __Eliminate waste__: Don't code more features than needed

Principle #2- __Build Quality In__: "Quality is everyone's responsibility" - _Edwards Deming_
verify that quality is built into the product and process.

Principle #3- __Create Knowledge__: AKA (Amplifying learning). Development is constant learning

Principle #4- __Defer Commitment__: Make decision at the right time, After analysis and consideration, Delay decisions until you have more information.
Two types of decision making:
One-way door: can't come back
two-way door: you can come back
decision making depends on distinction 

Principle #5- __Deliver fast__: ensure feedback received early and often, Allow for course correction, smaller batches allow you to deliver faster

Principle #6- __Respect People__: Lack respect for people in your culture?, Lean and DevOps falls apart

Principle #7- __Optimizing the whole__: Employ systems thinking

Waste #1- __Partially done work__: delays delivery of value and leads to quality issues

Waste #2- __Extra Features__: don't build more than customer needs

Waste #3- __Revisiting Decisions__: resurfacing decisions or information is wasteful

Waste #4- __Handoffs__: includes back and forth communication

Waste #5- __Delays__: whenever process has to wait to proceed

Waste #6- __Task Switching__: research proves "multitasking" is the enemy of all productivity!

Waste #7- __Defects__: build quality in from the get-go!

## Improvement Kata

It comes from toyota production system and it is a process for __continuous improvement__

Steps in improvement kata:

1. Understand __vision__ & __direction__ for project
2. Analyze to understand __current condition__
3. Establish __target condition__
4. Plan > Do > Check > Act [PDCA] toward target
