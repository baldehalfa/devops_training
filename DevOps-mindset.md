# DevOps Mindset

## Defining DevOps
"DevOps is about __humans__. It is a set of practices and patterns that turn __human capital__ into high-performance __organizational-capital__" - _John Willis_

"DevOps is the emerging professional movement that advocates a __collaborative__ working __relationship__ between Development and IT Operations, resulting in the fast flow of planned work (For example: high deployment rates), while simultaneously increasing the __reliability__, __stability__, __resilience__ and __security__ of the product environment." - _Gene Kim_

A full lifecycle consists of __Building__, __Deploying__, __Operating__, and __Supporting__

## DevOps Principals 
__Deming Quote__: "It is not necessary to change. __Survival is not mandatory__." _- Dr. William Edwards Deming_

__System Thinking__: __The three ways__ developed by __Gene Kim__ and __Mike Orzen__

1- __System Thinking__: Emphasizes __performance__ of the entire system. Also __collaboration__ across functional lines and focus on IT-enabled __value streams__
The outcome of system thinking are the following: __stop passing defects__ downstream, Does not allow local optimization, Always seeking to __increase flow__, and always seeking to profound __understanding__ of the system
__Quote:__ "Quality is __everyone's responsibility__". _- Edwards Deming_

2- __Amplifying feedback loops__
__Feedback Loops__ is a process that allows for refection on its own output before determining the next steps that need to be completed.
The outcome of feedback loops are the following: understanding and responding to all customers, shortening and amplifying all feedback loops, and then embedding knowledge where needed.
To improve feedback loops, we need to: build __automated tests__ into pipeline and also embed operations engineer into development teams.


3- A culture of continuous experimentation and learning
